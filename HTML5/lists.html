        <h1>Lists</h1>
        <!-- Component start -->
        <p>This page provides a variety of lists to test proper behaviour with browsers and
            <ABBR title="assistive technologies">ATs</ABBR>.</p>
        <h3>Single Level</h3>
        <h4>UL</h4> The first list demonstrates an unsorted list. A peculiarity of UL and OL is that nothing normally goes inside the list tags except list items. If you place anything inside a UL or OL but not within the LI structure, it is still indented, like this use of the phrase "three fruit". Most
        <ABBR title="assistive technologies">ATs</ABBR> will treat the phrase "three fruit" as part of the list, and may even label the list using this text, although that isn't part of the specification.
        <ul>
            <li>bananas</li>
            <li>apples</li>
            <li>oranges</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>OL</h4> The second list demonstrates an enumerated list. I'll give you three reasons you use this:
        <ol>
            <li>you want to indicate sequence</li>
            <li>you want to rank or otherwise indicate order</li>
            <li>you like numbers better than bullets, even though, as with this list, the numbering is pretty arbitrary</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>DL</h4> A definition list should be used exclusively for structuring definitions. Unlike the other lists, it consists of a three-part structure. There is the DL, which indicates the beginning and end of a definition list. Unlike OL and UL, text inside the DL but outside the inner tags is not immediately indented.
        <dl>
            <dt>DT or Definition Term</dt>
            <dd>The Term is the word or phrase being defined</dd>
            <dt>DD, or Definition Description</dt>
            <dd>The DD describes the term. In this example DL, there are two sets of terms and descriptions.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Nested lists</h3> With a nested list, a new UL or OL is put inside an existing UL or OL. As with simple lists, the user agent will handle indentation and bullet variations.
        <h4>Ingredients as nested list</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Wet
                <ul>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Milk</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dry
                <ul>
                    <li>Flour</li>
                    <li>Sugar</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions as nested list</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix dry ingredients
                <ol>
                    <li>Put 1 cup flour in bowl</li>
                    <li>Add 1 Tbsp sugar</li>
                    <li>Ad 1 tsp salt and mix</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Mix wet ingredients
                <ol>
                    <li>Measure 1 cup milk</li>
                    <li>Add a egg and blend</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Add wet ingredients into dry ingredients</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Unordered tasks with ordered tasks nested</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rake the yard</li>
            <li>Wash the clothes
                <ol>
                    <li>Sort the clothes</li>
                    <li>Set the washing machine correctly</li>
                    <li>Add the detergent</li>
                    <li>Start the machine</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
